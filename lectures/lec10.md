```

---

### ⏰ Temporal Score (Optional)

**🔧 Modifying Factors:**
* **💣 Exploit Code Maturity:** Unproven / Proof-of-Concept / Functional / High
* **🔧 Remediation Level:** Official Fix / Temporary Fix / Workaround / Unavailable
* **📊 Report Confidence:** Unknown / Reasonable / Confirmed

**📉 Impact:** Can lower base score
* 📊 Example: CVSS 9.0 base → 7.5 final (no exploit available yet, patch ready)
* ⏰ Changes over time (exploit released = score increases)

---

### 🏢 Environmental Score (Optional)

**🎯 Organization-Specific Adjustments:**
* **🔐 Confidentiality Requirement:** How sensitive is your data?
* **✅ Integrity Requirement:** How critical is data accuracy?
* **⚡ Availability Requirement:** How critical is uptime?

**💼 Example Scenarios:**
* 🛒 **E-commerce site:** Availability = High (downtime = lost revenue)
* 📝 **Blog site:** Availability = Low (downtime = minimal impact)
* 🏥 **Healthcare:** Confidentiality = High (HIPAA data)
* 💰 **Finance:** Integrity = High (transaction accuracy critical)

**📊 Result:** Same vulnerability = different scores per organization

<details>
<summary>💭 <strong>CVSS Limitations:</strong> What it doesn't tell you</summary>

**❌ CVSS doesn't consider:**
* 🎯 **Exploitability in the wild** (use EPSS for this)
* 💼 **Business impact** (use environmental score)
* 🔧 **Ease of remediation** (patch available vs. major refactor)
* 🔍 **Reachability** (is vulnerable code actually executed?)
* 🏢 **Your specific environment** (production vs. dev)
* ⏰ **Attack trends** (is it being exploited now?)

**✅ CVSS is ONE input, not the ONLY factor:**
* 📊 Combine: CVSS + EPSS + KEV + Context = Smart prioritization
* 🎯 Use as baseline, adjust with intelligence
* 🧠 Apply judgment, don't follow blindly

**💡 Pro tip:** CVSS 9.0 with 0% exploitation = lower priority than CVSS 7.0 with active exploits
</details>

## 📍 Slide 5 – ⚡ Advanced Prioritization: EPSS, KEV, SSVC

* 🎯 **Problem:** CVSS measures severity, NOT likelihood of exploitation
* 📊 **Solution:** Combine multiple signals for intelligent prioritization
* 🧠 **Smart approach:** Likelihood × Impact × Context = Priority

```mermaid

### ⚡ EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System)

* 🎯 **EPSS:** Probability of exploitation in next 30 days
* 📊 **Score range:** 0-100% (e.g., 45% = 45% chance of active exploitation)
* 🤖 **ML-powered:** Trained on real-world exploitation data from honeypots, IDS, threat intel
* 📅 **Updated:** Daily with new data
* 🔗 **Database:** [first.org/epss](https://www.first.org/epss/)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    EPSS[⚡ EPSS Score] --> High[> 70%<br/>Fix NOW]
    EPSS --> Med[30-70%<br/>Watch Close]
    EPSS --> Low[< 10%<br/>Normal Priority]
    
    style High fill:#ffebee,stroke:#c62828,stroke-width:3px,color:#2c3e50
```

**💡 Example Prioritization:**
* 🔴 **CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell):** CVSS 10.0 + EPSS 97% → **DROP EVERYTHING, FIX NOW**
* 🟡 **CVE-2023-12345:** CVSS 9.8 + EPSS 0.3% → High severity but low exploitation → lower priority

**🎯 How to Use EPSS:**
* 🚨 EPSS > 70% → Treat as urgent (high exploitation risk)
* ⚠️ EPSS > 30% → Monitor closely (emerging threat)
* ✅ EPSS < 10% → Can deprioritize (low exploitation risk)

---

### 🚨 CISA KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities)

* 🏛️ **CISA KEV:** Catalog of vulnerabilities actively exploited in the wild RIGHT NOW
* 🔥 **If in KEV:** Being exploited by attackers at this moment
* ⏰ **US Gov mandate:** Patch KEV vulnerabilities within 15 days (federal agencies)
* 📊 **Catalog size:** 1,000+ actively exploited vulnerabilities
* 🔗 **Catalog:** [cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog)

**🎯 KEV = Always Highest Priority:**
* 🔴 Even Low CVSS + in KEV = Fix immediately
* ⚡ Real-world exploitation confirmed
* 🚨 Attackers have tools and knowledge

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Vuln[🚨 Vulnerability] --> Check{In KEV?}

### 🎯 SSVC (Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization)

* 🎯 **SSVC:** Decision tree for vulnerability prioritization
* 📊 **Factors:** Exploitation status, Technical impact, Automatable, Mission impact
* 🔀 **Output:** Act immediately / Act / Track / Track*
* 🧠 **Benefit:** More nuanced than simple CVSS scoring

**🌳 Decision Tree Questions:**
1. ❓ Is it being exploited? (KEV check)
2. ❓ Is it automatable? (wormable, self-spreading?)
3. ❓ What's technical impact? (Total/Partial/Minor)
4. ❓ What's mission impact? (Mission Essential/Support/Not Critical)

**📊 Result:** Context-aware prioritization decision

### 📊 Combined Prioritization Matrix

| CVSS | EPSS | KEV | Final Priority | Action | Timeline |
|------|------|-----|----------------|--------|----------|
| 9-10 | >70% | ✅ Yes | 🔴 **P0** | Fix immediately | ⏰ 24 hours |
| 9-10 | >70% | ❌ No | 🟠 **P1** | Fix urgently | ⏰ 48 hours |
| 9-10 | <30% | ❌ No | 🟡 **P2** | Fix this week | ⏰ 7 days |
| 7-8.9 | >70% | ✅ Yes | 🟠 **P1** | Fix urgently | ⏰ 48 hours |

<summary>💭 <strong>Real Scenario:</strong> 100 Vulnerabilities, What to Fix First?</summary>

**❌ Old Approach (CVSS only):**
* 🔴 Fix all 30 Critical (CVSS 9-10) first
* ⏰ Timeline: 6 months to clear all Critical
* 🚨 Meanwhile, actively exploited High severity vulns remain

**✅ Smart Approach (Combined signals):**
* 🔥 **3 in KEV catalog** → Fix TODAY (P0)
* ⚡ **7 with EPSS > 50%** → Fix THIS WEEK (P1)
* 🎯 **20 with CVSS 9+ but EPSS < 5%** → Fix NEXT MONTH (P2)

**📊 Result:**
* ✅ Fixed the 10 that matter most in 1 week
* 🎯 80% risk reduction with 10% effort
* ⏰ Not 6 months, just 1 week for critical threats

**💡 Lesson:** Work smarter, not harder. Prioritize by actual threat, not just severity.

## 📍 Slide 6 – 🎯 Risk-Based Prioritization

* 🎯 **Risk = Likelihood × Impact × Exposure**
* 🏢 **Context matters:** Same vulnerability = different risk in different environments
* 📊 **Your environment:** Production vs. dev, internet-facing vs. internal, customer data vs. test data

### 🏢 Contextual Risk Factors

**🎯 Asset Criticality:**
* 🔴 Production, customer-facing → **Highest priority**
* 🟡 Staging, internal tools → **Medium priority**
* 🟢 Development, testing → **Lower priority**
* ⚪ Sandbox, demo → **Lowest priority**

**🌍 Exposure Level:**
* 🌐 Internet-facing public API → **Highest priority**
* 🏢 Internal service, VPN-only → **Medium priority**
* 🔒 Private network, authenticated → **Lower priority**
* 🏝️ Air-gapped system → **Lowest priority**

**💼 Data Sensitivity:**
* 💳 Payment data (PCI-DSS), PII (GDPR) → **Highest priority**
* 📊 Confidential business data → **Medium priority**
* 📝 Non-sensitive business data → **Lower priority**
* 🌍 Public data → **Lowest priority**

**🛡️ Compensating Controls:**
* ✅ WAF in front (Web Application Firewall) → **Reduce priority**
* ✅ Network segmentation (isolated) → **Reduce priority**
* ✅ Strong authentication (MFA) → **Reduce priority**
* ❌ No controls → **Increase priority**

---

### 🔍 Reachability Analysis

* 🎯 **Critical question:** Is vulnerable code actually executed in your application?
* 📊 **Reality:** ~70% of vulnerabilities may be unreachable (code exists but never runs)
* 🔧 **Tools:** Snyk (reachability feature), GitHub CodeQL (dataflow analysis)

**💡 Example:**
* 📦 Vulnerability in lodash.template() function
* 🔍 Your code imports lodash but never calls .template()
* ✅ Vulnerability exists but **NOT exploitable**
* 🎯 Action: Lower priority (but don't ignore forever - transitive risk)

```mermaid

    style Lower fill:#fffde7,stroke:#f9a825,stroke-width:2px,color:#2c3e50
```

---

### 📊 Custom Risk Scoring

**🧮 Example Formula:**

**Risk Score = (CVSS × 0.3) + (EPSS × 100 × 0.3) + (Criticality × 0.2) + (Exposure × 0.2)**

**Where:**
* 📊 CVSS: 0-10 (severity)
* ⚡ EPSS: 0-1, multiplied by 100 (likelihood)
* 🏢 Criticality: 0-10 (0=dev, 5=staging, 10=prod)
* 🌍 Exposure: 0-10 (0=internal, 5=VPN, 10=internet)

**💡 Example Calculation:**
* 🔴 SQL injection in production API
* 📊 CVSS: 9.8
* ⚡ EPSS: 0.45 (45%)
* 🏢 Criticality: 10 (production)
* 🌍 Exposure: 10 (internet-facing)
* **🎯 Risk Score:** (9.8×0.3) + (45×0.3) + (10×0.2) + (10×0.2) = **20.4/30 (HIGH)**

**🚨 Action:** Fix immediately (P0 priority)

<details>
<summary>💭 <strong>Tune Your Formula:</strong> One size doesn't fit all</summary>

**🛒 E-commerce Company:**
* ⬆️ Higher weight: Availability impact (downtime = lost sales)
* ⬆️ Higher weight: Exposure (public-facing)
* ⬇️ Lower weight: Internal tools

**🏥 Healthcare Organization:**
* ⬆️ Higher weight: Data sensitivity (HIPAA compliance)
* ⬆️ Higher weight: Integrity impact (data accuracy)
* ⬆️ Higher weight: Confidentiality

**🏢 Internal Tools Company:**
* ⬇️ Lower weight: Exposure (mostly internal)
* ⬆️ Higher weight: Criticality (mission-critical vs. nice-to-have)

**🎯 Strategy:**
1. ✅ Start with default weights (balanced approach)
2. 📊 Track outcomes (are you fixing the right things?)
3. 🔄 Adjust weights based on your incidents
4. 📈 Iterate quarterly (refine based on data)

**💡 Remember:** Your risk tolerance ≠ other companies' risk tolerance

### ✅ Triage Decision Matrix

| Condition | Decision | Action | Timeline |
|-----------|----------|--------|----------|
| 🚨 In KEV catalog | **🔧 Fix** | Immediate remediation | ⏰ 24h |
| 🔴 Critical + Production | **🔧 Fix** | Urgent patch | ⏰ 24-48h |
| 🟠 High + No patch available | **🛡️ Mitigate** | WAF rule, network block | ⏰ 48h |
| 🟢 Low + Legacy system EOL | **✅ Accept** | Document risk, monitor | 📋 Review quarterly |
| 🤖 Scanner false detection | **❌ False Positive** | Mark, tune scanner | ⏰ Same day |
| 🟡 Medium + Low EPSS | **⏰ Defer** | Add to backlog | 📋 Next sprint |

---

### 🔧 Fix Decision (Permanent Remediation)

**✅ When to Fix:**
* 🔴 High risk (CVSS + EPSS + KEV + context)
* 🏭 Production environment affected
* 💊 Patch available from vendor
* 🚫 No acceptable workaround
* 📈 Business impact significant

**🛠️ Fix Strategies:**
* 📦 Update dependency (SCA findings)
* 🔐 Apply security patch (OS/library updates)
* 💻 Code change (SAST findings - rewrite vulnerable code)
* ⚙️ Configuration change (IaC findings)

---

### 🛡️ Mitigate Decision (Temporary Control)

**⚠️ When to Mitigate:**
* ❌ No patch available yet (zero-day situation)
* 🧪 Patch breaks functionality (needs testing)
* ⏰ Fix requires major refactor (time-consuming)
* 🔄 Waiting for vendor patch release

**🔧 Mitigation Strategies:**
* 🔥 **WAF rule:** Block exploit pattern (ModSecurity, AWS WAF)
* 🌐 **Network segmentation:** Limit access (VPN, IP whitelisting)
* 🔒 **Authentication layer:** Add additional auth requirement
* ⏱️ **Rate limiting:** Slow down potential attacks
* 📊 **Enhanced monitoring:** Detect exploitation attempts
* 🚫 **Feature flag:** Temporarily disable vulnerable feature

**⚠️ Remember:** Mitigations are temporary - must still fix root cause

---

### ✅ Accept Risk Decision (Documented Exception)

**📋 When to Accept:**
* 🟢 Low risk (Low CVSS + Low EPSS + Not in KEV)
* 🚫 Not reachable (dead code, never executed)
* 🛡️ Strong compensating controls (already well-protected)
* 💰 Cost > Benefit (legacy system retiring in 30 days)
* 🏗️ Architectural limitation (would require full rewrite)

**📋 Requirements for Risk Acceptance:**
* 📝 Document decision (why accepting, what's the risk)
* 👔 Get approval (manager, security team, or risk committee)
* 📅 Set review date (re-evaluate quarterly or when context changes)
* 🔔 Monitor continuously (ensure assumption remains valid)
* ⚖️ Legal sign-off (if compliance-related)

---

### ❌ False Positive Handling

**🔍 Common False Positives:**
* 🧪 Test code flagged as vulnerable (not in production)
* 💀 Dead code never executed (commented out, unreachable)
* ⚙️ Scanner misconfiguration (wrong context)
* 🔄 Duplicate of already-fixed issue (tool lag)
* 🎯 Context misunderstanding (looks vulnerable but isn't)

**✅ Process:**
1. 🔍 Validate (is it really a false positive? Double-check)
2. 🏷️ Mark in tool (prevent re-reporting in future scans)
3. ⚙️ Tune scanner (adjust rules, add exceptions)
4. 📊 Track FP rate (metric: should be < 20%)
5. 🔄 Review periodically (false positives can become real)

<details>
<summary>💭 <strong>Triage SLA:</strong> Speed kills (vulnerabilities, that is!)</summary>

**⏰ Recommended Triage Speed:**
* 🔴 **Critical:** Triage within 4 hours (same business day)
* 🟠 **High:** Triage within 24 hours (next business day)
* 🟡 **Medium:** Triage within 3 days
* 🟢 **Low:** Triage within 1 week

**📊 Why Speed Matters:**
* ⏰ Old vulnerabilities = forgotten vulnerabilities
* 📚 Triage backlog = accumulating risk
* 🎯 Fast triage = faster fixes
* 📈 Metric: Average triage time (track and improve)

**🎯 Goal:** Zero vulnerabilities untriaged > 1 week

**💡 Pro Tip:**
* 🤖 Automate triage where possible (auto-FP, auto-defer low EPSS)
* 👥 Dedicated triage rotation (security champion duty)
* 📊 Daily standup includes triage queue review

---

### 💊 Patching Strategy (Dependencies)

**✅ When:** Vulnerability in third-party library or package

**📋 Process:**
1. 🔍 Check patch availability (is update available?)
2. 📖 Review changelog (breaking changes? migration needed?)
3. 📝 Update version in manifest (package.json, pom.xml, requirements.txt)
4. 🔒 Update lockfile (package-lock.json, Pipfile.lock)
5. 🧪 Test thoroughly (automated tests + manual testing)
6. 🚀 Deploy (gradual rollout recommended)

**🤖 Automation Options:**
* 🔄 Dependabot creates auto-PRs
* ✅ CI/CD runs automated test suite
* 🔀 Auto-merge for patch updates (if tests pass)
* 📊 Rollback on failure detection

---

### 💻 Code Change Strategy (Application Vulnerabilities)

**✅ When:** Vulnerability in your own code (SAST findings)

**📋 Process:**
1. 🧠 Understand vulnerability (root cause analysis, not just symptom)
2. 🔧 Write secure fix (follow secure coding guidelines)
3. 🧪 Write regression test (prevent reoccurrence)
4. 👀 Security-focused code review (peer review with security lens)
5. 🚀 Deploy through normal release cycle

**💡 Example Types:**
* 🔓 SQL injection → Use parameterized queries
* 🌐 XSS → Proper output encoding
* 🔐 Weak crypto → Use strong algorithms
* 🔑 Auth bypass → Fix authorization logic

---

### ⚙️ Configuration Change Strategy

**✅ When:** Misconfiguration vulnerability (IaC findings)

**📋 Process:**
1. 📝 Update IaC code (Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible)
2. 🔍 Run IaC security scan (verify fix)
3. 🧪 Test in staging environment
4. 🚀 Apply changes (terraform apply, cloudformation update)
5. ✅ Verify actual state (check cloud console)

**💡 Example Fixes:**
* 🪣 Public S3 bucket → Set ACL to private, enable block public access
* 🔓 Open security group → Restrict to specific IPs/ports
* 🔐 Unencrypted database → Enable encryption at rest

---

### 🛡️ Workaround Strategy (Temporary Mitigation)

**⚠️ When:** Cannot fix immediately (zero-day, testing needed, major refactor)

**🔧 Temporary Options:**
* 🔥 **WAF rule:** Block specific attack patterns
* 🌐 **Network isolation:** Restrict network access
* 🔒 **Additional authentication:** Add extra auth layer
* ⏱️ **Rate limiting:** Slow down potential attacks
* 🚫 **Feature flag:** Disable vulnerable functionality
* 📊 **Enhanced logging:** Detect exploitation attempts

**⚠️ Critical:** Workarounds are NOT solutions - must still fix permanently

---

### ❌ When NOT to Fix

**📋 Valid Reasons:**
* ✅ False positive (not actually vulnerable)
* ✅ Risk accepted (documented, approved decision)
* ✅ Not reachable (dead code, never executed)
* ✅ System retiring (EOL < 30 days)
* ✅ Compensating controls sufficient

**📝 Important:** Document decision, get approval, set review date

## 📍 Slide 9 – ⏱️ SLA Management & Tracking

* ⏱️ **SLA (Service Level Agreement)** = maximum time to fix vulnerability
* 🎯 **Based on severity:** Critical faster than Low
* 📊 **Track compliance:** Percentage fixed within SLA targets
* 🚨 **Escalate violations:** Don't let things slip through cracks

**📋 Standard SLA Table:**

| Severity | 🎯 SLA Target | ⏰ Clock Starts | 🚨 Escalation Point |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 🔴 Critical | 24 hours | ✅ After triage | 🚨 12h → Manager |
| 🟠 High | 7 days | ✅ After triage | 🚨 5d → Manager |
| 🟡 Medium | 30 days | ✅ After triage | 🚨 25d → Track closely |
| 🟢 Low | 90 days | ✅ After triage | 🚨 80d → Review validity |

```

---

### ⏰ SLA Clock Management

**✅ When SLA Starts:**
* ✅ After vulnerability triaged and assigned
* ✅ Not when scanner finds it (unknown at that point)
* ✅ Not when it first existed (impossible to know)

**⏸️ SLA Pause Scenarios:**
* ⏸️ Waiting for vendor patch (documented)
* ⏸️ Blocked by external dependency
* ⏸️ Requires business decision (escalated)

**❌ Not Valid Pauses:**
* ❌ "We're busy with features" (security is priority)
* ❌ "Waiting for next sprint" (security doesn't wait)
* ❌ "Not enough resources" (escalate for resources)

---

### 📊 SLA Metrics to Track

**🎯 Key Metrics:**
* 📈 **SLA compliance rate:** % vulnerabilities fixed within SLA
* ⏰ **Average fix time:** Mean time by severity
* 🚨 **SLA violations:** Count of breaches
* 📅 **Aging violations:** Vulnerabilities past SLA deadline
* 📊 **Trend analysis:** Improving or degrading over time

**💼 Dashboard Example:**
* 🔴 Critical: 95% within SLA (Target: 100%) - ⚠️ Needs improvement
* 🟠 High: 88% within SLA (Target: 90%) - 📈 Close to target
* 🟡 Medium: 72% within SLA (Target: 80%) - 🚨 Action needed
* 🟢 Low: 65% within SLA (Target: 70%) - 📉 Backlog issue

---

### 🚨 SLA Escalation Path

**🔄 Escalation Workflow:**
* 📅 **Day 0:** Developer assigned, notification sent
* ⏰ **50% SLA:** Automated reminder (Slack, email)
* 📢 **75% SLA:** Team lead notified, daily check-ins
* 🚨 **100% SLA (breach):** Manager escalation, root cause analysis
* 🔴 **150% SLA:** Executive involvement, process review

**🎯 Goal:** Prevent slipping through cracks, ensure accountability

---

## 📍 Slide 10 – 🔄 Remediation Tracking & Verification

* 🔄 **Track lifecycle:** Open → In Progress → Fixed → Verified → Closed
* 🧪 **Verification critical:** Don't trust "fixed" without testing
* 📊 **Prevent recurrence:** Same vulnerability shouldn't return
* 📈 **Metrics matter:** Fix rate, aging, recurrence rate

### 📊 Vulnerability States Explained

* 📋 **Open:** Triaged, waiting for developer assignment or pickup
* ⚙️ **In Progress:** Developer actively working on fix
* ✅ **Fixed:** Code changed, patch applied, deployed to environment
* 🧪 **Verified:** Tested and confirmed vulnerability no longer exists
* 🔒 **Closed:** Permanently resolved, archived
* ❌ **False Positive:** Not a real vulnerability, marked and closed

**📊 Metric:** Average days in each state (identify bottlenecks)

---

### 🧪 Verification Checklist

**✅ Before closing vulnerability:**
1. 🔍 **Rescan:** Vulnerability scanner no longer detects it
2. 🧪 **Test:** Exploitation attempt fails (try to exploit manually)
3. 👀 **Code review:** Fix is actually secure (not just hiding symptom)
4. 🔄 **Regression test:** Added to test suite (won't return)
5. 📝 **Documentation:** Updated secure coding guidelines (if applicable)

**⚠️ Don't Skip Verification:**
* 🚨 "Fixed" ≠ Actually fixed (common mistake)
* 🧪 Always test the fix
* 🔄 Verify in production (not just staging)

### 🔄 Recurrence Prevention

* 🔄 **Recurrence:** Same vulnerability type reappears
* 🎯 **Root causes:** Incomplete fix, code duplication, no tests, lack of training
* 📊 **Target metric:** Recurrence rate < 5%

**✅ Prevention Strategies:**
* 🔍 **Root cause analysis:** Why did it happen? Why did it return?
* 🧪 **Regression tests:** Automated tests prevent reoccurrence
* 🎓 **Secure coding training:** Educate developers on patterns
* 🔧 **Linting rules:** Detect pattern automatically (ESLint, SonarQube rules)
* 📋 **Secure code templates:** Provide secure examples
