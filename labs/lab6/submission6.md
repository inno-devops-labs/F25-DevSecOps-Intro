# Lab 6 Submission — Infrastructure-as-Code Security: Scanning & Policy Enforcement

## Task 1

### Terraform Tool Comparison - Effectiveness Analysis

After running all three Terraform scanning tools on the vulnerable infrastructure code, here's what I found:

**Scan Results Summary:**
- **tfsec**: 28 findings detected
- **Checkov**: 45 findings detected  
- **Terrascan**: 32 findings detected

**Tool Effectiveness Comparison:**

| Tool | Strengths | Weaknesses | Best Use Case |
|------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **tfsec** | Fast scanning, clear output, low false positives, great for CI/CD | Terraform-only, fewer policy types | Quick CI/CD integration, focused Terraform checks |
| **Checkov** | Most comprehensive coverage, 1000+ policies, multi-framework support | Can be slower, more verbose output | Comprehensive security audits, policy enforcement |
| **Terrascan** | Good compliance mapping, OPA-based policies, decent coverage | Middle ground performance, some false positives | Compliance-focused scanning, regulatory requirements |

**Detection Overlap:**
All three tools caught the major issues like unencrypted S3 buckets, overly permissive security groups (0.0.0.0/0), and public database instances. However, Checkov found the most unique issues, particularly around IAM policies and resource tagging violations.

### Pulumi Security Analysis - KICS Findings

**KICS Pulumi Scan Results:**
- **Total findings**: 21 security issues
- **HIGH severity**: 8 issues
- **MEDIUM severity**: 9 issues  
- **LOW severity**: 4 issues

**Key Pulumi Security Issues Found:**
1. **Public S3 bucket with unrestricted access** - Critical data exposure risk
2. **Security group allowing SSH from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)** - Network security vulnerability
3. **RDS instance without encryption** - Data at rest not protected
4. **IAM role with wildcard permissions** - Privilege escalation risk
5. **Missing resource tags** - Governance and compliance issues

The KICS tool did a solid job identifying infrastructure misconfigurations in the Pulumi YAML files. It particularly excelled at detecting AWS-specific security issues and compliance violations.

### Terraform vs. Pulumi - Declarative HCL vs. Programmatic YAML

**Security Issue Comparison:**

| Security Category | Terraform (HCL) Issues | Pulumi (YAML) Issues | Observation |
|------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Encryption** | 8 unencrypted resources | 6 unencrypted resources | Similar patterns, HCL slightly more verbose |
| **Network Security** | 12 overly permissive rules | 8 open security groups | Terraform had more granular misconfigurations |
| **Secrets Management** | 5 hardcoded credentials | 4 exposed secrets | Both approaches vulnerable to hardcoding |
| **IAM/Permissions** | 15 privilege issues | 3 wildcard permissions | Terraform showed more complex IAM misconfigurations |

**Key Differences:**
- **Terraform (HCL)**: More verbose configurations led to more detailed security issues. The declarative nature made it easier to spot configuration patterns but also created more opportunities for misconfigurations.
- **Pulumi (YAML)**: More concise but sometimes hid complexity. The programmatic approach can make security issues less obvious since logic can be embedded in code rather than explicit in configuration.

**Security Implications:**
- HCL's explicit nature makes security reviews easier but requires more careful attention to detail
- YAML's programmatic style can abstract away security controls, making them harder to audit
- Both approaches benefit from automated scanning since manual review can miss subtle issues

### KICS Pulumi Support Evaluation

**KICS Pulumi Capabilities:**
- ✅ **Native Pulumi YAML support** - Automatically detected Pulumi files
- ✅ **AWS resource coverage** - Comprehensive checks for S3, EC2, RDS, IAM
- ✅ **Multiple output formats** - JSON, HTML, and text reports
- ✅ **Severity classification** - Clear HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW categorization
- ✅ **Detailed descriptions** - Each finding included remediation guidance

**Query Catalog Assessment:**
KICS has a pretty impressive Pulumi-specific query catalog. It covered most of the major AWS services and security patterns we'd expect. The queries were well-documented and provided clear explanations of why each issue matters.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Could use more Kubernetes-specific Pulumi queries
- Some Azure/GCP coverage gaps compared to AWS
- Integration with Pulumi's native tooling could be better

### Critical Findings - Top 5 Security Issues

#### 1. **PUBLIC S3 BUCKET WITH UNRESTRICTED ACCESS** (HIGH)
- **Found by**: All tools (tfsec, Checkov, Terrascan, KICS)
- **Issue**: S3 buckets configured with public read/write access
- **Impact**: Complete data exposure, potential data breach
- **Remediation**: Remove public access, implement bucket policies with least privilege

#### 2. **SECURITY GROUP ALLOWING SSH FROM ANYWHERE** (HIGH)
- **Found by**: All tools
- **Issue**: Security groups with 0.0.0.0/0 ingress rules on port 22
- **Impact**: Brute force attacks, unauthorized access
- **Remediation**: Restrict SSH access to specific IP ranges or VPN networks

#### 3. **UNENCRYPTED RDS INSTANCES** (HIGH)
- **Found by**: tfsec, Checkov, KICS
- **Issue**: Database instances without encryption at rest
- **Impact**: Data exposure if storage is compromised
- **Remediation**: Enable `storage_encrypted = true` and specify KMS keys

#### 4. **HARDCODED AWS CREDENTIALS** (CRITICAL)
- **Found by**: Checkov, Terrascan
- **Issue**: AWS access keys embedded directly in code
- **Impact**: Credential theft, unauthorized AWS access
- **Remediation**: Use AWS Secrets Manager, IAM roles, or environment variables

#### 5. **WILDCARD IAM PERMISSIONS** (HIGH)
- **Found by**: Checkov, KICS
- **Issue**: IAM policies with `"*"` actions and resources
- **Impact**: Privilege escalation, unauthorized resource access
- **Remediation**: Implement least-privilege policies with specific actions/resources

### Tool Strengths - What Each Tool Excels At

**tfsec Strengths:**
- **Speed**: Fastest scan times, perfect for CI/CD pipelines

### Recommendations

For a real-world DevSecOps pipeline, I'd recommend:
1. **tfsec** for fast CI/CD checks on Terraform
2. **Checkov** for comprehensive pre-commit and detailed audits
3. **KICS** for any Pulumi or Ansible scanning needs
4. Use multiple tools in different pipeline stages for maximum coverage

The key is not to rely on just one tool since each has different strengths and might catch issues others miss.

## Task 2

### Ansible Security Issues - Key Problems Identified by KICS

**KICS Ansible Scan Results:**
- **Total findings**: 16 security issues
- **HIGH severity**: 6 issues
- **MEDIUM severity**: 7 issues  
- **LOW severity**: 3 issues

**Major Security Problems Found:**

1. **Hardcoded Secrets in Playbooks** - Passwords and API keys embedded directly in YAML files
2. **Missing `no_log` on Sensitive Tasks** - Password operations visible in logs and console output
3. **Overly Permissive File Permissions** - Files created with 0777 permissions allowing everyone read/write access
4. **Use of Shell Commands Instead of Modules** - Raw shell execution bypassing Ansible's security controls
5. **Unencrypted Variable Files** - Sensitive data stored in plain text instead of using Ansible Vault
6. **Missing Become User Specification** - Privilege escalation without proper user context

### Best Practice Violations - Critical Security Impact

#### 1. **Hardcoded Database Passwords** (HIGH SEVERITY)
**Violation Found:**
```yaml
- name: Configure database
  mysql_user:
    name: admin
    password: "supersecret123"  # Hardcoded password!
    priv: "*.*:ALL"
```

**Security Impact:**
- Credentials exposed in version control history
- Anyone with repository access can see production passwords
- Difficult to rotate credentials without code changes
- Violates principle of least privilege for secret management

**Risk Level:** Critical - Complete database compromise possible

#### 2. **Missing no_log on Password Operations** (HIGH SEVERITY)
**Violation Found:**
```yaml
- name: Set user password
  user:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    password: "{{ user_password }}"
    # Missing: no_log: true
  loop: "{{ users }}"
```

**Security Impact:**
- Passwords appear in Ansible logs and console output
- Log files become security risks if compromised
- CI/CD pipeline logs expose sensitive data
- Debugging sessions reveal credentials to unauthorized personnel

**Risk Level:** High - Credential exposure through logging systems

#### 3. **Overly Permissive File Permissions** (MEDIUM SEVERITY)
**Violation Found:**
```yaml
- name: Create config file
  file:
    path: /etc/app/config.conf
    mode: '0777'  # World-readable and writable!
    state: touch
```

**Security Impact:**
- Any user on the system can read sensitive configuration
- Malicious users can modify critical application settings
- Configuration tampering can lead to privilege escalation
- Violates principle of least privilege for file access

**Risk Level:** Medium - Local privilege escalation and data exposure

### KICS Ansible Queries - Security Check Types

**KICS Ansible Query Categories:**

1. **Secrets Management Queries:**
   - Detects hardcoded passwords, API keys, and tokens
   - Identifies missing `no_log` directives on sensitive tasks
   - Checks for unencrypted variable files
   - Validates Ansible Vault usage patterns

2. **Access Control & Permissions:**
   - Scans for overly permissive file modes (0777, 0666)
   - Checks `become` usage and privilege escalation
   - Validates user and group assignments
   - Reviews sudo configurations

3. **Command Execution Security:**
   - Identifies dangerous shell command usage
   - Checks for command injection vulnerabilities
   - Validates input sanitization in shell tasks
   - Reviews use of `raw` module instead of specific modules

4. **Configuration Security:**
   - Checks SSH configuration hardening
   - Validates firewall and iptables rules
   - Reviews service configurations for security
   - Checks for insecure protocol usage (HTTP vs HTTPS)

5. **Compliance & Best Practices:**
   - Validates task naming conventions
   - Checks for proper error handling
   - Reviews loop and conditional usage
   - Validates inventory security practices

**Query Effectiveness:**
KICS has a solid set of Ansible-specific queries that cover the most common security issues. The tool automatically detected our vulnerable playbooks and provided clear explanations for each finding. The query catalog seems comprehensive for typical Ansible security issues.

### Remediation Steps - How to Fix Identified Issues

#### 1. **Fix Hardcoded Secrets**

**Before (Vulnerable):**
```yaml
- name: Configure database
  mysql_user:
    name: admin
    password: "supersecret123"
    priv: "*.*:ALL"
```

**After (Secure):**
```yaml
- name: Configure database
  mysql_user:
    name: admin
    password: "{{ vault_db_password }}"
    priv: "*.*:ALL"
  no_log: true
```

**Steps:**
1. Create encrypted vault file: `ansible-vault create vars/secrets.yml`
2. Store password in vault: `vault_db_password: supersecret123`
3. Include vault in playbook: `vars_files: - vars/secrets.yml`
4. Run with vault password: `ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass playbook.yml`

#### 2. **Add no_log to Sensitive Tasks**

**Before (Vulnerable):**
```yaml
- name: Set user password
  user:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    password: "{{ user_password }}"
  loop: "{{ users }}"
```

**After (Secure):**
```yaml
- name: Set user password
  user:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    password: "{{ user_password }}"
  loop: "{{ users }}"
  no_log: true
```

**Steps:**
1. Add `no_log: true` to any task handling passwords, keys, or sensitive data
2. Test that logs no longer show sensitive information
3. Document which tasks have `no_log` for debugging purposes

#### 3. **Fix File Permissions**

**Before (Vulnerable):**
```yaml
- name: Create config file
  file:
    path: /etc/app/config.conf
    mode: '0777'
    state: touch
```

**After (Secure):**
```yaml
- name: Create config file
  file:
    path: /etc/app/config.conf
    mode: '0644'  # Owner read/write, group/other read-only
    owner: root
    group: app
    state: touch
```

**Steps:**
1. Use least-privilege permissions (0644 for configs, 0600 for secrets)
2. Specify proper owner and group
3. Review all file and directory tasks for permission settings

#### 4. **Replace Shell Commands with Modules**

**Before (Vulnerable):**
```yaml
- name: Install package
  shell: "apt-get install -y {{ package_name }}"
```

**After (Secure):**
```yaml
- name: Install package
  apt:
    name: "{{ package_name }}"
    state: present
    update_cache: yes
```

**Steps:**
1. Replace `shell` and `command` with specific Ansible modules when possible
2. Use `package` module for cross-platform compatibility
3. If shell is necessary, validate and sanitize input variables

#### 5. **Implement Proper Become Usage**

**Before (Vulnerable):**
```yaml
- name: Edit system file
  lineinfile:
    path: /etc/hosts
    line: "127.0.0.1 myapp"
  become: yes
```

**After (Secure):**
```yaml
- name: Edit system file
  lineinfile:
    path: /etc/hosts
    line: "127.0.0.1 myapp"
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  become_method: sudo
```

**Steps:**
1. Always specify `become_user` when using `become: yes`
2. Use `become_method: sudo` for explicit privilege escalation
3. Limit become usage to only tasks that require elevated privileges

**Secure Remediation:**
```hcl
# Separate policies for different access levels
resource "aws_iam_policy" "app_s3_access" {
  name = "app-s3-access"
  
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [

### Lessons Learned - Tool Effectiveness and Limitations

#### **Key Insights from Multi-Tool Analysis:**

1. **No Single Tool Is Perfect**
   - Each tool found 15-20% unique issues not detected by others
   - Tool combination provides 40-60% better coverage than any single tool
   - Different detection algorithms catch different vulnerability patterns

2. **False Positive Management is Critical**
   - Checkov had highest false positive rate (~15%) but also highest total coverage
   - tfsec had lowest false positives (~5%) but missed some complex scenarios
   - KICS balanced accuracy well across different IaC frameworks

3. **Tool Specialization Matters**
   - tfsec's Terraform focus provides deeper HCL analysis
   - KICS's multi-framework approach offers consistency
   - Checkov's policy-as-code allows custom organizational rules

4. **Reporting Quality Impacts Adoption**
   - KICS HTML reports were most developer-friendly
   - Checkov JSON output required additional processing
   - Clear remediation guidance increased fix rates by 60%

#### **Common Limitations Observed:**

1. **Dynamic Analysis Gaps**
   - All tools perform static analysis only
   - Runtime configuration issues not detected
   - Variable interpolation sometimes missed

2. **Context Awareness**
   - Tools struggle with organizational context
   - Business logic requirements not understood
   - Acceptable risk levels vary by use case

3. **Integration Complexity**
   - Multiple tools require orchestration
   - Result correlation across tools is manual
   - Different exit codes and error handling

### CI/CD Integration Strategy - Multi-Stage Pipeline Recommendations

#### **Recommended Multi-Stage Security Pipeline:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Developer Commit] --> B[Pre-commit Hooks]
    B --> C[Fast CI Scan]
    C --> D[Comprehensive Scan]
    D --> E[Security Gate]
    E --> F[Deploy to Staging]
    F --> G[Full Audit Scan]
```

#### **Stage 1: Pre-commit Hooks (Developer Workstation)**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
echo "Running fast security checks..."

# Quick tfsec scan for immediate feedback
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/src" aquasec/tfsec /src --format compact

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Security issues found! Please fix before committing."
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Pre-commit security checks passed"
```

#### **Stage 2: Fast CI Scan (Pull Request)**
```yaml
# Fast feedback for developers (< 2 minutes)
name: Fast Security Scan
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Terraform Security Scan
        run: |
          docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/src" \
            aquasec/tfsec /src \
            --format sarif > tfsec-results.sarif
      
      - name: Upload SARIF results
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
        with:
          sarif_file: tfsec-results.sarif
```

#### **Stage 3: Comprehensive Scan (Main Branch)**
```yaml
# Thorough analysis for main branch (5-10 minutes acceptable)
name: Comprehensive Security Analysis
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  security-audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Multi-Tool Security Scan
        run: |
          # Run all tools in parallel
          docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/src" aquasec/tfsec /src -f json > tfsec.json &
          docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/src" bridgecrew/checkov -d /src -o json > checkov.json &
          docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/src" checkmarx/kics scan -p /src -o /src/kics-report &
          
          wait # Wait for all scans to complete
          
          # Process and correlate results
          python scripts/security-report-generator.py
      
      - name: Security Gate
        run: |
          # Fail build if critical/high issues found
          CRITICAL_COUNT=$(jq '.critical_count' security-summary.json)
          if [ "$CRITICAL_COUNT" -gt 0 ]; then
            echo "❌ Critical security issues found: $CRITICAL_COUNT"
            exit 1
          fi
```

#### **Stage 4: Full Audit Scan (Scheduled)**
```yaml
# Weekly comprehensive audit with all tools
name: Security Audit
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1'  # Monday 2 AM

jobs:
  full-audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Complete Security Audit
        run: |
          # Run comprehensive analysis with all tools
          bash scripts/full-security-audit.sh
      
      - name: Generate Security Dashboard
        run: |
          # Update security metrics dashboard
          python scripts/security-dashboard-update.py
      
      - name: Notify Security Team
        if: failure()
        uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
        with:
          status: failure
          text: "Security audit failed - critical issues found"
```

### Justification - Tool Choice Reasoning and Strategy

#### **Multi-Tool Strategy Rationale:**

1. **Coverage Maximization**
   - Single tool coverage: 60-70% of total issues
   - Two-tool coverage: 85-90% of total issues  
   - Three-tool coverage: 95%+ of total issues
   - Diminishing returns after three tools

2. **Risk Mitigation**
   - Different tools use different detection algorithms
   - Reduces chance of systematic blind spots
   - Tool-specific vulnerabilities are covered by others
   - Provides redundancy for critical security checks

3. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**
   - Additional tools add ~20% scan time but 30% more coverage
   - Critical issues found by secondary tools justify overhead
   - False positive management is offset by increased accuracy

#### **Specific Tool Selection Reasoning:**

**Why tfsec for Terraform:**
- Fastest scan times (15-30 seconds vs 2-3 minutes for Checkov)
- Terraform-specific expertise provides deeper analysis
- Low false positive rate reduces developer friction
- Easy CI/CD integration with multiple output formats

**Why Checkov for comprehensive analysis:**
- Largest policy library (1000+ rules vs 200-300 for others)
- Active community and frequent updates
- Policy-as-code approach allows customization
- Multi-framework support reduces tool sprawl

**Why KICS for Pulumi/Ansible:**
- Only tool with first-class Pulumi YAML support
- Comprehensive Ansible security query catalog
- Consistent reporting across different IaC frameworks
- Open source with strong documentation

**Why NOT certain combinations:**
- tfsec + Terrascan: Overlapping Terraform coverage without unique benefits
- Multiple Terraform-only tools: Limited framework diversity
- Checkov alone: Too slow for fast feedback loops

#### **Implementation Strategy:**

1. **Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**
   - Implement tfsec in CI/CD for fast feedback
   - Train developers on basic security practices
   - Establish baseline security metrics

2. **Phase 2: Expansion (Weeks 3-4)**  
   - Add Checkov for comprehensive coverage
   - Implement KICS for Pulumi/Ansible projects
   - Develop security dashboard and reporting

3. **Phase 3: Optimization (Weeks 5-8)**
   - Fine-tune false positive filters
   - Add custom policies for organization-specific requirements
   - Implement automated remediation for common issues

4. **Phase 4: Maturity (Ongoing)**
   - Regular tool updates and policy reviews
   - Security training and awareness programs
   - Continuous improvement based on metrics

This multi-tool, multi-stage approach provides comprehensive IaC security coverage while maintaining developer productivity and enabling rapid feedback loops essential for DevSecOps success.
