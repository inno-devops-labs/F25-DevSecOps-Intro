## üõ†Ô∏è Tools to Use

Students should scan this code with:

### Terraform
- **tfsec**: Fast Terraform security scanner
- **Checkov**: Policy-as-code security scanner
- **Terrascan**: OPA-based compliance scanner

### Pulumi
- **KICS (Checkmarx)**: Open-source scanner with first-class Pulumi YAML support
  - Dedicated Pulumi queries catalog (AWS/Azure/GCP/Kubernetes)
  - Auto-detects Pulumi platform
  - Provides comprehensive security analysis

### Ansible
- **KICS (Checkmarx)**: Open-source scanner with comprehensive Ansible security queries
  - Dedicated Ansible queries catalog
  - Auto-detects Ansible playbooks
  - Provides comprehensive security analysis

### Policy-as-Code
- **Conftest/OPA**: Custom policy enforcement for all IaC types

## üìã Expected Student Outcomes

Students should:
1. Identify all 80+ security vulnerabilities across Terraform, Pulumi, and Ansible code
   - Note: Pulumi code includes both Python and YAML formats for comprehensive analysis
2. Compare detection capabilities of different tools
3. Compare security issues between declarative (Terraform HCL) and programmatic (Pulumi Python/YAML) IaC
4. Evaluate KICS's first-class Pulumi support and query catalog
5. Understand false positives vs true positives
6. Write custom policies to catch organizational-specific issues
7. Provide remediation steps for each vulnerability class
8. Recommend tool selection strategies for CI/CD pipelines

## üîß How to Use (Students)

```bash
# Copy vulnerable code to your lab directory
cp -r vulnerable-iac/terraform/* labs/lab6/terraform/
cp -r vulnerable-iac/pulumi/* labs/lab6/pulumi/
cp -r vulnerable-iac/ansible/* labs/lab6/ansible/

# Scan with multiple tools (see lab6.md for commands)
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/labs/lab6/terraform":/src aquasec/tfsec:latest /src
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/labs/lab6/terraform":/tf bridgecrew/checkov:latest -d /tf
docker run -t --rm -v "$(pwd)/labs/lab6/pulumi":/src checkmarx/kics:latest scan -p /src -o /src/kics-report --report-formats json,html
# ... and more
```
