in the secure model we switched all HTTP links to HTTPS and enabled transparent disk encryption on Persistent Storage. This eliminated the unencrypted-communication risks and reduced some server-side-request-forgery findings. All other risk categories remained unchanged, showing that encryption mainly mitigates transport-layer and storage-layer threats while leaving application-layer risks intact.
