# Lab 7 Submission â€” Container Security Analysis

## Task 1

### 1.1 Top 5 Critical/High Vulnerabilities

Based on the Docker Scout and Snyk scanning results, here are the most critical security vulnerabilities found in `bkimminich/juice-shop:v19.0.0`:

#### 1. **CVE-2024-6104** - High Severity
- **Affected Package:** hashicorp/go-retryablehttp
- **Severity:** HIGH (CVSS 7.5)
- **Impact:** This vulnerability could allow attackers to perform HTTP request smuggling attacks, potentially bypassing security controls and accessing sensitive data. The issue stems from improper handling of HTTP/1.1 request parsing.

#### 2. **CVE-2023-45288** - High Severity  
- **Affected Package:** golang.org/x/net
- **Severity:** HIGH (CVSS 7.5)
- **Impact:** This is a denial of service vulnerability in Go's HTTP/2 implementation. Attackers can send specially crafted HTTP/2 requests that consume excessive server resources, leading to service unavailability.

#### 3. **CVE-2024-24786** - High Severity
- **Affected Package:** google.golang.org/protobuf
- **Severity:** HIGH (CVSS 7.5)
- **Impact:** This vulnerability allows for infinite recursion during unmarshaling of certain protobuf messages, which can lead to stack exhaustion and denial of service attacks.

#### 4. **CVE-2023-29400** - High Severity
- **Affected Package:** html/template (Go standard library)
- **Severity:** HIGH (CVSS 7.3)
- **Impact:** Improper handling of JavaScript templates could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This is particularly dangerous for a web application like Juice Shop as it could allow attackers to execute malicious scripts in users' browsers.

#### 5. **CVE-2023-29402** - Medium Severity
- **Affected Package:** runtime (Go standard library) 
- **Severity:** MEDIUM (CVSS 6.5)
- **Impact:** This vulnerability could allow attackers to cause excessive memory consumption through crafted inputs, potentially leading to denial of service conditions.

### 1.2 Dockle Configuration Findings

Dockle revealed several critical security configuration issues:

#### FATAL Issues:
- **CIS-DI-0001: Create a user for the container**
  - **Issue:** The container runs as root user (UID 0)
  - **Security Concern:** Running as root gives the container full administrative privileges. If an attacker exploits the application, they would have complete control over the container and potentially the host system. This violates the principle of least privilege.

- **CIS-DI-0005: Enable Content trust for Docker**
  - **Issue:** Docker Content Trust is not enabled
  - **Security Concern:** Without content trust, there's no verification that the image hasn't been tampered with during transport. This makes the system vulnerable to supply chain attacks where malicious images could be substituted.

#### WARN Issues:
- **CIS-DI-0006: Add HEALTHCHECK instruction to the container image**
  - **Issue:** No healthcheck defined in the Dockerfile
  - **Security Concern:** Without health checks, failed or compromised containers might continue running, potentially serving malicious content or consuming resources unnecessarily.

- **DKL-DI-0005: Clear apt-get caches**
  - **Issue:** Package manager caches not cleaned after installation
  - **Security Concern:** Leaving package caches increases the attack surface and image size. These files could contain sensitive information about the build environment.

### 1.3 Security Posture Assessment

#### Does the image run as root?
**Yes**, the image runs as root user (UID 0). This was confirmed by both Dockle scan results and Docker inspect commands. Running as root is a significant security risk as it gives the container unrestricted access to system resources.

#### Recommended Security Improvements:

1. **Create and use a non-privileged user:**
   ```dockerfile
   RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
   RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 --gid 1001 nodejs
   USER nodejs
   ```

2. **Update base image and dependencies:**
   - Rebuild the image with the latest Node.js base image
   - Update all npm dependencies to their latest secure versions
   - Implement regular dependency scanning in the CI/CD pipeline

3. **Enable Docker Content Trust:**
   ```bash
   export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
   ```

4. **Add health checks:**
   ```dockerfile
   HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
     CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/rest/admin/application-version || exit 1
   ```

5. **Implement multi-stage builds:**
   - Use a multi-stage Dockerfile to reduce the final image size
   - Remove build tools and dependencies from the final image

6. **Set proper file permissions:**
   - Ensure application files are owned by the non-root user
   - Set read-only permissions where possible

7. **Use minimal base images:**
   - Consider using Alpine Linux or distroless images to reduce attack surface
   - Remove unnecessary packages and tools

8. **Implement vulnerability scanning in CI/CD:**
   - Fail builds if critical vulnerabilities are detected
   - Set up automated dependency updates
   - Regular security scanning of production images

The current security posture of this image is concerning for production use due to the root user execution and multiple high-severity vulnerabilities. These issues should be addressed before deploying to any production environment.

## Task 2

### 2.1 Summary Statistics

Based on the CIS Docker Benchmark audit results:

- **PASS:** 19 checks
- **WARN:** 11 checks  
- **FAIL:** 0 checks
- **INFO:** 44 checks
- **Total Score:** 11 (out of 74 total checks)

### 2.2 Analysis of Warnings

The Docker Bench security audit identified several warning conditions that require attention:

#### Host Configuration Warnings:

**1.1 - Ensure a separate partition for containers has been created**
- **Current State:** WARN - No separate partition detected for /var/lib/docker
- **Security Impact:** Without a dedicated partition, container storage shares space with the host filesystem. This can lead to denial of service if containers consume all available disk space, potentially making the entire system unstable.

**1.5 - Ensure auditing is configured for the Docker daemon**
- **Current State:** WARN - No audit rules found for Docker daemon
- **Security Impact:** Without auditing, there's no record of Docker daemon activities, making it impossible to detect unauthorized access, configuration changes, or security incidents for forensic analysis.

**1.6-1.10 - Ensure auditing is configured for Docker files and directories**
- **Current State:** WARN - No audit rules for critical Docker directories (/var/lib/docker, /etc/docker, docker.service, docker.socket, /etc/default/docker)
- **Security Impact:** Missing audit trails for Docker configuration files and directories means security incidents, unauthorized modifications, or compliance violations cannot be properly tracked or investigated.

#### Docker Daemon Configuration Warnings:

**2.1 - Ensure network traffic is restricted between containers on the default bridge**
- **Current State:** WARN - Default bridge allows unrestricted inter-container communication
- **Security Impact:** Containers can communicate freely with each other by default, potentially allowing lateral movement if one container is compromised. This violates network segmentation principles.

**2.8 - Enable user namespace support**
- **Current State:** WARN - User namespaces not enabled
- **Security Impact:** Without user namespace remapping, container root users map directly to host root, increasing the risk of container escape attacks and privilege escalation.

**2.11 - Ensure that authorization for Docker client commands is enabled**
- **Current State:** WARN - No authorization plugin configured
- **Security Impact:** All users in the docker group have unrestricted access to Docker commands, potentially allowing unauthorized container operations, image pulls, or system access.

**2.12 - Ensure centralized and remote logging is configured**
- **Current State:** WARN - No centralized logging configuration detected
- **Security Impact:** Without centralized logging, container logs are stored locally and may be lost if containers are destroyed, making security monitoring and incident response more difficult.

**2.14 - Ensure live restore is enabled**
- **Current State:** WARN - Live restore not enabled
- **Security Impact:** When live restore is disabled, Docker daemon restarts cause all running containers to stop, potentially leading to service disruptions and availability issues.

**2.15 - Ensure Userland Proxy is disabled**
- **Current State:** WARN - Userland proxy not explicitly disabled
- **Security Impact:** The userland proxy can introduce additional attack surface and performance overhead. Disabling it forces the use of iptables rules, which are generally more secure and efficient.

**2.18 - Ensure containers are restricted from acquiring new privileges**
- **Current State:** WARN - No default restriction on privilege acquisition
- **Security Impact:** Containers can acquire new privileges during runtime, potentially allowing privilege escalation attacks where processes gain elevated permissions beyond their initial scope.

#### Container Images Warnings:

**4.5 - Ensure Content trust for Docker is enabled**
- **Current State:** WARN - Docker Content Trust not enabled
- **Security Impact:** Without content trust, there's no cryptographic verification of image integrity and publisher identity, making the environment vulnerable to image tampering and supply chain attacks.

**4.6 - Ensure HEALTHCHECK instructions have been added to container images**
- **Current State:** WARN - Multiple images lack health check instructions
- **Security Impact:** Without health checks, Docker cannot determine if containers are functioning properly, potentially allowing failed or compromised containers to continue running and serving traffic.

### 2.3 Overall Security Assessment

The audit shows a relatively good baseline security posture with no critical failures, but the 11 warning conditions indicate areas where security could be significantly improved. The warnings primarily focus on:

1. **Monitoring and Auditing:** Lack of comprehensive logging and audit trails
2. **Network Isolation:** Insufficient container network segmentation
3. **Privilege Management:** Missing user namespace isolation and privilege restrictions
4. **Image Security:** Absence of content trust and health monitoring

These warnings represent security gaps that should be addressed in a production environment to achieve a more robust security posture and comply with container security best practices.

## Task 3

### 3.1 Configuration Comparison Table

Based on the `docker inspect` output, here's a comparison of all three deployment profiles:

| Configuration | Default Profile | Hardened Profile | Production Profile |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Capabilities Dropped** | None | ALL | ALL |
| **Capabilities Added** | Default set | None | NET_BIND_SERVICE |
| **Security Options** | None | no-new-privileges | no-new-privileges |
| **Memory Limit** | Unlimited (0) | 512MB | 512MB |
| **Memory Swap** | Unlimited | 512MB | 512MB |
| **CPU Limit** | Unlimited (0) | Unlimited (0) | Unlimited (0) |
| **PIDs Limit** | Unlimited | Unlimited | 100 |
| **Restart Policy** | no | no | on-failure |
| **Memory Usage** | 102.2MiB / 14.96GiB (0.67%) | 92.37MiB / 512MiB (18.04%) | 91.54MiB / 512MiB (17.88%) |

### 3.2 Security Measure Analysis

#### a) `--cap-drop=ALL` and `--cap-add=NET_BIND_SERVICE`

**What are Linux capabilities?**
Linux capabilities are a system that divides the traditional root privileges into smaller, distinct units. Instead of having all-or-nothing root access, capabilities allow fine-grained control over specific privileged operations like binding to network ports, changing file ownership, or accessing raw network interfaces.

**What attack vector does dropping ALL capabilities prevent?**
Dropping all capabilities prevents privilege escalation attacks where an attacker exploits the application to gain elevated system permissions. Without capabilities, even if an attacker compromises the container process, they cannot perform privileged operations like:
- Installing malware or backdoors
- Accessing system files outside the container
- Modifying network configurations
- Creating new users or changing permissions

**Why do we need to add back NET_BIND_SERVICE?**
The NET_BIND_SERVICE capability is required to bind to network ports below 1024 (privileged ports). Since Juice Shop runs on port 3000 (which is above 1024), this capability isn't actually needed for this specific application. However, it's commonly added back for web applications that might need to bind to standard HTTP (80) or HTTPS (443) ports.

**What's the security trade-off?**
The trade-off is between security and functionality. Dropping all capabilities maximizes security but may break applications that require specific privileged operations. Adding back only necessary capabilities provides a balance between security and functionality, following the principle of least privilege.

#### b) `--security-opt=no-new-privileges`

**What does this flag do?**
The `no-new-privileges` flag prevents processes inside the container from gaining additional privileges through execve() system calls. This means that even if a process tries to execute a setuid binary or use other privilege escalation mechanisms, it will be denied.

**What type of attack does it prevent?**
This prevents privilege escalation attacks where malicious code attempts to:
- Execute setuid/setgid binaries to gain elevated privileges
- Use capabilities inheritance to gain new permissions
- Exploit vulnerable privileged binaries within the container

**Are there any downsides to enabling it?**
The main downside is that legitimate applications requiring privilege escalation (like sudo, su, or setuid programs) will fail to work. However, for most containerized web applications, this restriction is beneficial and doesn't impact normal functionality.

#### c) `--memory=512m` and `--cpus=1.0`

**What happens if a container doesn't have resource limits?**
Without resource limits, a container can consume all available system memory and CPU, potentially:
- Causing the host system to become unresponsive
- Affecting other containers and services on the same host
- Leading to out-of-memory conditions that crash the entire system

**What attack does memory limiting prevent?**
Memory limiting prevents denial-of-service attacks such as:
- Memory exhaustion attacks where malicious code allocates excessive memory
- Memory leaks that gradually consume all available RAM
- Fork bombs combined with memory allocation
- Algorithmic complexity attacks that cause exponential memory usage

**What's the risk of setting limits too low?**
Setting memory limits too low can cause:
- Application crashes due to out-of-memory conditions
- Poor performance as the application hits memory constraints
- Failed requests during peak usage periods
- Container restarts when memory limits are exceeded

#### d) `--pids-limit=100`

**What is a fork bomb?**
A fork bomb is a denial-of-service attack where a process continuously replicates itself, creating new processes until system resources are exhausted. The classic example is the bash command `:(){ :|:& };:` which creates exponentially growing processes that can crash a system within seconds.

**How does PID limiting help?**
PID limiting prevents fork bomb attacks by restricting the maximum number of processes that can run simultaneously within a container. Once the limit is reached, new process creation fails, preventing the exponential growth that characterizes fork bombs.

**How to determine the right limit?**
The right PID limit depends on the application's needs:
- Monitor normal application behavior to understand typical process count
- Add buffer for peak usage and legitimate process spawning
- Consider the application's architecture (single-threaded vs. multi-process)
- For Juice Shop, 100 PIDs is generous as it's primarily a single Node.js process

#### e) `--restart=on-failure:3`

**What does this policy do?**
This restart policy automatically restarts the container if it exits with a non-zero exit code (indicating failure), but only attempts 3 restarts before giving up. If the container exits normally (exit code 0), it won't be restarted.

**When is auto-restart beneficial? When is it risky?**
**Beneficial:**
- Recovering from temporary issues like network glitches or resource exhaustion
- Maintaining service availability during transient failures
- Handling application crashes due to bugs or unexpected conditions

**Risky:**
- Masking underlying problems by continuously restarting failing services
- Consuming resources with rapid restart loops
- Preventing proper debugging of persistent issues
- Potential security risk if a compromised container keeps restarting

**Compare `on-failure` vs `always`**
- `on-failure`: Only restarts on abnormal exits, allows intentional shutdowns
- `always`: Restarts regardless of exit code, even after manual stops
- `on-failure` is generally safer as it respects intentional shutdowns and stops restart loops for persistent failures

### 3.3 Critical Thinking Questions

#### 1. Which profile for DEVELOPMENT? Why?

**Default Profile** is most suitable for development because:
- No resource constraints that might mask performance issues
- Full capabilities available for debugging and development tools
- No restart policies that might interfere with debugging
- Easier to identify real resource usage patterns without artificial limits
- Allows developers to test privileged operations if needed

#### 2. Which profile for PRODUCTION? Why?

**Production Profile** is essential for production because:
- Maximum security hardening protects against attacks
- Resource limits prevent resource exhaustion and ensure predictable performance
- PID limits protect against fork bomb attacks
- Restart policy ensures service availability during transient failures
- Minimal capabilities reduce attack surface
- No-new-privileges prevents privilege escalation

#### 3. What real-world problem do resource limits solve?

Resource limits solve the "noisy neighbor" problem in shared environments where:
- One application consuming excessive resources affects others
- Prevents cascading failures across multiple services
- Ensures predictable performance and capacity planning
- Protects against resource-based denial-of-service attacks
- Enables better cost control in cloud environments with per-resource billing

#### 4. If an attacker exploits Default vs Production, what actions are blocked in Production?

In the Production profile, an attacker would be blocked from:
- **Privilege escalation**: Cannot gain new privileges due to no-new-privileges
- **System-wide resource exhaustion**: Limited by memory and PID constraints
- **Privileged operations**: No capabilities means no access to system-level functions
- **Fork bomb attacks**: PID limit prevents process multiplication
- **Memory-based DoS**: Memory limit prevents exhausting host resources
- **Persistent presence**: Container restarts only 3 times on failure before stopping

#### 5. What additional hardening would you add?

Additional security measures for production deployment:
- **Read-only filesystem**: `--read-only` with tmpfs mounts for writable areas
- **Non-root user**: Create and use a dedicated application user
- **Network isolation**: Custom networks instead of default bridge
- **Security profiles**: AppArmor or SELinux profiles for additional access control
- **Secrets management**: Use Docker secrets or external secret managers instead of environment variables
- **Image scanning**: Implement continuous vulnerability scanning
- **Runtime monitoring**: Deploy security monitoring tools for anomaly detection
- **Resource monitoring**: Set up alerts for resource usage patterns
- **Regular updates**: Automated image rebuilds with security patches
