# Lab Submission 3: Commit Signing with GPG/SSH Keys

## Summary: Benefits of Signing Commits for Security

Signing commits ensures that code contributions are **authentic and tamper-proof**. It allows developers and reviewers to:

- Verify the identity of the commit author.
- Prevent unauthorized changes from being introduced into the codebase.
- Improve trust in collaborative environments and CI/CD pipelines.
- Enhance auditability, especially for security-sensitive projects.

Signed commits are a critical part of maintaining integrity and accountability in software projects.

##Analysis: Why Commit Signing is Critical in DevSecOps Workflows##

In DevSecOps, security is integrated into every stage of the software development lifecycle. Commit signing is critical because it:

*Prevents supply chain attacks: Verifies that code changes are from trusted contributors.

*Supports automated compliance checks: CI/CD pipelines can enforce that only signed commits are merged.

*Increases accountability: Each contribution can be traced to a verified developer, reducing insider threat risks.

*Facilitates trust in open-source contributions: Particularly important when integrating external libraries or modules.

Overall, signed commits strengthen the security posture and integrity of the development process.
