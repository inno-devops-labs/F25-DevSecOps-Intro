# Lab 3 Submission

## Task 1 - SSH Commit Signature Verification 
### Summary explaining the benefits of signing commits for security:
Commit signing provides cryptographic verification that:
- **Authenticity**: Confirms the commit was made by the claimed author
- **Integrity**: Ensures the commit content hasn't been tampered with
- **Non-repudiation**: Prevents authors from denying their commits

### Evidence of successful SSH key setup and configuration
1. Generated SSH key with:
    ```$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "a.antipov@innopolis.university"```

2. Configured Git to use SSH signing:
    ```
    $ git config --global gpg.format ssh
    $ git config --global user.signingkey ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    $ git config --global commit.gpgSign true
    $ nano ~/.ssh/allowed_signers
    $ git config --global gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile ~/.ssh/allowed_signers
    $ git config --local user.name Lone_Lord
    $ git config --local user.email a.antipov@innopolis.university```


3. Verified signed commit:
    ```
    $ git log --show-signature -1
    commit 53bed4902e33d003c12d07d845163b37469c71e8 (HEAD -> feature/lab3, origin/feature/lab3)
    Good "git" signature for a.antipov@innopolis.university with ED25519 key SHA256:...
    Author: Lone_Lord <a.antipov@innopolis.university>
    Date:   Fri Sep 26 14:52:46 2025 +0300

    checks: check sign```


4. On GitHub the commit appears with the green **Verified** badge.

### Analysis: "Why is commit signing critical in DevSecOps workflows?"
In DevSecOps, security is integrated into every step of the development lifecycle.  
Commit signing is critical because:
- It ensures that only authorized developers contribute code.
- It reduces the risk of supply chain attacks where malicious actors inject code into repositories.
- It enables traceability and accountability of all code changes.
- It provides compliance with security standards and audit requirements.
- In CI/CD pipelines, signed commits guarantee that only verified code is deployed.

## Task 2 ‚Äî Pre-commit Secret Scanning

### Pre-commit hook setup process and configuration
```
$ vim .git/hooks/pre-commit
$ vim labs/lab3/test.txt
$ vim labs/lab3/.env
$ vim docker-compose.yml
$ git add .
$ git commit -S -m "checks: open secret, 11 try"
```
### Evidence of successful secret detection blocking commits

```
$ git commit -S -m "checks: open secret, 11 try"

### Analysis of how automated secret scanning prevents security incidents

Automated secret scanning stops sensitive data like API keys or passwords from being committed to Git. This prevents accidental leaks into repositories, where attackers could exploit them. By detecting issues early, it reduces security risks and enforces safer development practices.
