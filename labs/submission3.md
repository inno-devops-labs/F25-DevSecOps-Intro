Signed commits cryptographically verify the author's identity, ensuring commits come from trusted sources and preventing impersonation. They guarantee code integrity by proving that the commit content has not been tampered with since it was signed. This is crucial for secure collaboration, especially in open-source projects where maintainers need to validate contributions from unknown developers. Additionally, signed commits provide a verifiable audit trail that meets compliance requirements for enterprises and protects critical infrastructure projects from malicious code changes.
